# Title

> What it takes to be a CEO in the 2020s

**take to**

1. (尤指短时间接触后的喜欢上，喜爱)

2. 养成做...的习惯

3. 逃亡，躲到

   ==The rebels took to the hills. 反叛者躲进山里。==

# Preface

> The rules of management are being ripped up. Bosses need to adapt.

**rip sth/up**

1. 把某物撕碎，这里引申为淘汰


# Paragraph 1

> On paper this is a golden age for bosses. Chief executives have vast power. The 500 people who run America’s largest ==listed firms== ==hold sway== over 26m staff. Profits are high and the economy is ==purring==. The pay is fantastic: the ==median== of those CEOs pockets \$13m a year. Sundar Pichai at Alphabet has just got a deal worth up to \$246m by 2023. The risks are tolerable: your chances of being fired or retiring in any year are about 10%. CEOs  often get away with a dreadful ==performance==. In April Ginni Rometty will ==stand down== from IBM after eight years in which Big Blue’s shares have ==trailed== the stockmarket by 202%. Adam Neumann got high in private jets and lost $4bn before being ==ousted== from WeWork last year. The only big drawback is all those meetings, which eat up two-thirds of the typical boss’s working hours.

**sway**

​	v. 

1. 摇摆、摆动

2. 统治

   ==Rebel forces **hold sway** over much of the island.==

**listed firms**

​	上市公司

**purring**

​	这是==purr==的现在分词，千万别认为是==pure==分词。但是具体含义不是很理解，这里翻译译为***利润很高，经济也蒸蒸日上***。

**median**

​	n. 中值、中位数

**performance**

​	n. 工作情况、业绩

**stand down**

​	离职

**trailed**

​	v. 原型为==trail==, 被拖，拉~

**ousted**

​	v. 原型为==oust==， 强迫某人离职或下台



# Paragraph 2



>Yet CEOs say the job has got harder. Most ==point the finger at== “disruption”, the idea that competition is more intense. But they have been saying that for years. In fact the evidence suggests that, as America’s economy has become more ==sclerotic==, big firms have been able to ==count on== ==cranking out== high profits for longer. Nonetheless, bosses are right that something has changed. The nature of the job is being disrupted. In particular, CEOs ’ mechanism for exercising control over their vast enterprises is failing, and where and why firms operate is in ==flux==. That has big ==implications== for business, and for anyone climbing the corporate ladder.

**point the finger at**

​	这里的意思引申为：将矛头指向...

**disruption**

​	n. 破坏

​	**rupture**

​		n&v. 破裂

**sclerotic**

 	adj. 僵化的

**count on**

 1. 期望、预计

    ==I'll be back, you can count on it.== 我会回来的，你要相信。

 2. 依赖

**crank out**

​	快速地大量制造，尤指粗制滥造

​	**crank**

​	n. (想法)古怪的人、（脾气坏、容易恼怒）的人

**Nonetheless** SYN **Nevertheless**

​	adv. 尽管如此、不过、然而

**flux**

​	n. 不断的变化

​	注意这句话中的==where and why firms operate==, 翻译为：公司在哪里运营和为什么要运营...

​	这里的where的内容和why的内容是一致的，所以就省略了一半。

**implication**

​	n. 含意、影响



# Paragraph 3

>Few subjects attract more voodoo analysis than management. Even so, studies suggest that the quality of an American firm’s leadership explains about 15% of the variance in profitability. But boards and headhunters struggle to identify who will do a good job (see [Briefing](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/06/corporate-headhunters-are-more-powerful-than-ever)). Perhaps as a result, they tend to make conservative choices. About 80% of CEOs come from within the company and over half are engineers or have MBAs. Most are white and male, although that is changing slowly.
