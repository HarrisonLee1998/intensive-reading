# Title

> What it takes to be a CEO in the 2020s

**take to**

1. (尤指短时间接触后的喜欢上，喜爱)

2. 养成做...的习惯

3. 逃亡，躲到

   ==The rebels took to the hills. 反叛者躲进山里。==

# Preface

> The rules of management are being ripped up. Bosses need to adapt.

**rip sth/up**

1. 把某物撕碎，这里引申为淘汰


# Paragraph 1

> On paper this is a golden age for bosses. Chief executives have vast power. The 500 people who run America’s largest ==listed firms== ==hold sway== over 26m staff. Profits are high and the economy is ==purring==. The pay is fantastic: the ==median== of those ceos pockets \$13m a year. Sundar Pichai at Alphabet has just got a deal worth up to \$246m by 2023. The risks are tolerable: your chances of being fired or retiring in any year are about 10%. ceos often get away with a dreadful ==performance==. In April Ginni Rometty will ==stand down== from ibm after eight years in which Big Blue’s shares have ==trailed== the stockmarket by 202%. Adam Neumann got high in private jets and lost $4bn before being ==ousted== from WeWork last year. The only big drawback is all those meetings, which eat up two-thirds of the typical boss’s working hours.

**sway**

1. 摇摆、摆动

2. 统治

   ==Rebel forces **hold sway** over much of the island.==

**listed firms**

​	上市公司

**purring**

​	这是==purr==的现在分词，千万别认为是==pure==分词。但是具体含义不是很理解，这里翻译译为***利润很高，经济也蒸蒸日上***。

**median**

​	中值、中位数

**performance**

​	工作情况、业绩

**stand down**

​	离职

**trailed**

​	原型为==trail==, 被拖，拉~

**ousted**

​	原型为==oust==， 强迫某人离职或下台
