# Title

> What it takes to be a CEO in the 2020s

**take to**

1. (尤指短时间接触后的喜欢上，喜爱)

2. 养成做...的习惯

3. 逃亡，躲到

   ==The rebels took to the hills. 反叛者躲进山里。==

# Preface

> The rules of management are being ripped up. Bosses need to adapt.

**rip sth/up**

1. 把某物撕碎，这里引申为淘汰


# Paragraph 1

> On paper this is a golden age for bosses. Chief executives have vast power. The 500 people who run America’s largest ==listed firms== ==hold sway== over 26m staff. Profits are high and the economy is ==purring==. The pay is fantastic: the ==median== of those CEOs pockets \$13m a year. Sundar Pichai at Alphabet has just got a deal worth up to \$246m by 2023. The risks are tolerable: your chances of being fired or retiring in any year are about 10%. CEOs  often get away with a dreadful ==performance==. In April Ginni Rometty will ==stand down== from IBM after eight years in which Big Blue’s shares have ==trailed== the stockmarket by 202%. Adam Neumann got high in private jets and lost $4bn before being ==ousted== from WeWork last year. The only big drawback is all those meetings, which eat up two-thirds of the typical boss’s working hours.

**sway**

​	v. 

1. 摇摆、摆动

2. 统治

   ==Rebel forces **hold sway** over much of the island.==

**listed firms**

​	上市公司

**purring**

​	这是==purr==的现在分词，千万别认为是==pure==分词。但是具体含义不是很理解，这里翻译译为***利润很高，经济也蒸蒸日上***。

**median**

​	n. 中值、中位数

**performance**

​	n. 工作情况、业绩

**stand down**

​	离职

**trailed**

​	v. 原型为==trail==, 被拖，拉~

**ousted**

​	v. 原型为==oust==， 强迫某人离职或下台



# Paragraph 2



>Yet CEOs say the job has got harder. Most ==point the finger at== “disruption”, the idea that competition is more intense. But they have been saying that for years. In fact the evidence suggests that, as America’s economy has become more ==sclerotic==, big firms have been able to ==count on== ==cranking out== high profits for longer. Nonetheless, bosses are right that something has changed. The nature of the job is being disrupted. In particular, CEOs ’ mechanism for exercising control over their vast enterprises is failing, and where and why firms operate is in ==flux==. That has big ==implications== for business, and for anyone climbing the corporate ladder.

**point the finger at**

​	这里的意思引申为：将矛头指向...

**disruption**

​	n. 破坏

​	**rupture**

​		n&v. 破裂

**sclerotic**

 	adj. 僵化的

**count on**

 1. 期望、预计

    ==I'll be back, you can count on it.== 我会回来的，你要相信。

 2. 依赖

**crank out**

​	快速地大量制造，尤指粗制滥造

​	**crank**

​	n. (想法)古怪的人、（脾气坏、容易恼怒）的人

**Nonetheless** SYN **Nevertheless**

​	adv. 尽管如此、不过、然而

**flux**

​	n. 不断的变化

​	注意这句话中的==where and why firms operate==, 翻译为：公司在哪里运营和为什么要运营...

​	这里的where的内容和why的内容是一致的，所以就省略了一半。

**implication**

​	n. 含意、影响



# Paragraph 3

>Few subjects attract more voodoo analysis than management. Even so, studies suggest that the quality of an American firm’s leadership explains about 15% of the variance in profitability. But boards and headhunters struggle to identify who will do a good job (see [Briefing](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/06/corporate-headhunters-are-more-powerful-than-ever)). Perhaps as a result, they tend to make conservative choices. About 80% of CEOs come from within the company and over half are engineers or have MBAs. Most are white and male, although that is changing slowly.



# Paragraph 4

> This tiny elite faces big changes, starting with how they control their firms. Ever since Alfred Sloan ==shook up== General Motors in the 1920s, the main tool that CEOs have ==wielded== is the control of physical investment, a process known as capital allocation. The firm and the CEO have had clear jurisdiction over a defined set of assets, staff, products and ==proprietary== information. Think of “Neutron” Jack Welch, who ran General Electric between 1981 and 2001, opening and shutting plants, buying and selling ==divisions==, and ==ruthlessly== controlling the flow of capital.

**shook up**

​	**shook**为**shake**的过去式

​	v.

​	v.

1. 拥有，运用，行使（权力等）

 	2. 使用（武器，工具等）

**proprietary**

​	adj.

1. 专卖的，专营的

 	2. 所有权的

**division**

​	n. 部门

**ruthlessly**

​	adv. 无情地，残忍地

​	**ruthless** 

​	adj. 无情的，残忍的



# Paragraph 5

>  Today, however, 32% of firms in the s&p 500 of big American firms invest more in intangible assets than physical ones, and 61% of the market value of the s&p 500 sits in intangibles such as research and development (r&d), customers linked by network effects, brands and data. The link between the CEO ==authorizing== investment and getting results is unpredictable and opaque.	

**authorize**

​	v. 授权

# Paragraph 6

> Meanwhile the boundaries of the firm, and the CEO’s authority, are blurring. Uber’s 4m drivers are not employees and neither are the millions of workers in Apple’s supply chain, but they are mission-critical. Big firms spent $32bn last year on cloud services from a few powerful vendors. Factories and offices have billions of sensors pumping sensitive information to suppliers and customers. Middle-managers talk business on social media.





# Paragraph 7

> Even as CEOs’ authority is being redefined, a shift is under way in where firms operate. Generations of bosses have obeyed the call to “go global”. But in the past decade the profitability of multinational investment abroad has ==soured==, so that returns on capital are a ==puny== 7%. Trade ==tensions== mean that CEOs face the prospect of ==repatriating== activity or redesigning supply chains. Most have only just begun to ==grapple== with this.

**soured**

​	adj.

​	酸的，阴郁的；这里引申为**国外投资的盈利能力下降了**

**puny**

​	adj.

​	弱小的，不起眼的

**tension**

​	n. 紧张局势，冲突；拉伸，张力

**repatriate**

​	v.

​	~ sth: 寄钱回国，将利润调回本国

**grapple**

​	v. 扭打，搏斗

​	

# Paragraph 8

> The last change is ==over== the purpose of the firm. The ==orthodoxy== has been that they operate in the interests of their owners. But pressure is coming from above, as politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren call on CEOs to ==favour== staff, suppliers and clients more; and from below, as both customers and young workers demand that firms take a stand on social issues. Alphabet has faced ==rolling== staff protests.

**over**

​	prep. 关于；在本句中的意思为：**最近的改变是公司的目的。**

**orthodoxy**

​	n. 正统观念，普遍接受的概念

**favour**

​	v. 特别照顾，偏袒

**rolling**

​	adj. 周而复始的



# Paragraph 9

> CEOs are experimenting, with ==underwhelming== results. Reed Hastings at Netflix ==preaches== ==radical== ==autonomy==. Staff decide their ==expenses== and do without formal ==performance reviews==, an idea that at most firms would cause chaos. Others ==assert authority== by ==reviving== the 1980s ==cult== of celebrity. Sometimes it works: Satya Nadella has rebuilt Microsoft using “==empathetic== leadership”. Often it does not. MR Neumann’s ==stint== as WeWork’s party-animal-in-chief ended in ==fiasco==. Jeff Immelt, the ex-boss of General Electric, has been accused of “success theatre” by making himself a jet-setting star as its cashflow fell by 36%.

**underwhelming **

​	adj. 平庸的，索然无味的；本句译为：**CEO们正在进行实验，但是收效甚微。**

​	v. 苏醒，复活

**cult**

​	n. 狂热，崇拜

**empathetic**

**stint**

​	n. 工作期限

​	v. 节省，吝啬

**fiasco**

​	n. 惨败



# Paragraph 10

>  Keen to show they are engaged, bosses are publicly ==weighing in== on issues like ==abortion== and gun control. The danger is ==hypocrisy==. Goldman Sachs’s boss wants to “accelerate economic progress for all”, but it faces a huge fine for its role in the 1mdb corruption scandal in Malaysia. In August 181 American CEOs ==pledged to== serve staff, suppliers, communities and customers as well as shareholders. This is a promise, made during a long economic expansion, that they will not be able to keep. In a dynamic economy some firms have to shrink and ==shed== workers. It is silly to pretend there are no ==trade-offs==. Higher wages and more cash for suppliers mean lower profits or higher prices for consumers.

**weight in (with sth)**

**abortion**

​	n. 流产，堕胎

**hypocrisy**

# Paragraph 11

>The very model of a modern CEO
>
>What, ==then==, does it take to be a corporate leader in the 2020s? Every firm is different, but those hiring a CEO, or aspiring to be one, should ==prize== a few qualities. Mastering the ==tricky==, creative and more collaborative game of allocating intangible capital is essential. A CEO must be able to ==marshal== the data flowing between companies and their counterparties, redistributing who earns profits and bears risk. Some firms are ahead—Amazon monitors 500 measurable goals—but most CEOs are still stuck clearing their email inboxes at midnight. Last, bosses need to be clear that a firm should be run in the long-term interest of its owners. That does not mean being ==crusty== or ==myopic==. Any ==sensible== business should ==face up== to the risks from climate change, for example. It does mean avoiding mission creep. CEOs in the 2020s will have their ==hands full== with their own company, so forget trying to run the world too. And if, in between meetings, you find time to smoke ==weed== at 40,000 feet, don’t get caught.
